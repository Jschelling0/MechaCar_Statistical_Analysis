## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Statistical summary: ![image](summary.png)
### Which variables/coefficients provivded a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set are vehicle weight, length and and ground clearance. These values in the dataset could have a impact on the mpg of the MechaCar.
### Is the slope of teh linear model considered to be zero?
Since the p-value of the car model is 5.45 e-11, it is smaller than the significance value of .05. This idicates that the slope of the linear model is not zero.
### Does the linear model predict mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively?
The linear model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar protypes effectively. The reason being is that the r-squred value is 0.7149, meaning that roughly 71% of all predictions will be baesd off of the model.
